# Booklog
I created this site to introduce the books I have read and to let people know who I am through my books. Therefore, half of my target audience is job interviewers.

I have designed this site so that it is easy to look back at the books I have read. For example, when you want to search for a book, you can search by category. Also, when a book is displayed, books in the same category as the book are displayed at the bottom of the page. If there are not so many books in a category, the icon with a question mark will be displayed.

This site is written entirely in PHP, though it is made to look as if it were using a database. However, since the readability is significantly reduced when trying to write everything in one file, I have prepared several PHP files, one to handle data, one to handle classes, and one to display HTML.
